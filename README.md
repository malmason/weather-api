## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Steps used

1. Created the dashboard layout with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.
2. Tested 2 API's from Openweathermap, the [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api) to pull Lat and Lon coordinates to be used as parameters for the newer [One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) which returns a 7-day forecast.
3. Added Bootstrap button, select and card controls to the interface.
4. Added [icons](http://openweathermap.org/img/wn/04d.png) to the weather results from Openweather based on the icon name in the result set.
5. Added a custom js file, included variables and functions to work with moment.js, and Openweather.
6. Created functions for the JSON results to populate the dashboard and to save and retrieve data from local storage.
7. Added a custom css file for styling outside of Bootstrap.
8. Added a UV index scale to show the severity of the weather conditions.
9. Added a table to show the daily temperatures for the current day for High, Low, and Morn, Eve and Night timeframes.
